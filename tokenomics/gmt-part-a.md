### **GMT Earning Mechanics**&#x20;

#### **Level requirement**

GMT earning is only available to Sneakers that reaches to Level 30.



#### **Rule of Three Requirement**

It is a mandatory requirement to have AT LEAST three Energy in order to start earning GMT.



#### **Halving Mechanics**

Each day, a set number of GMT will be unlocked to earn. The daily release of GMT follows exponential decay pattern, on the first day of the 3rd year, the daily GMT unlocked is exactly halved compared to the 1st day of GMT been available to earn.



#### **Einstein Mechanics**

“_God tirelessly plays dice under laws which he has himself prescribed_”

The system constantly adds randomness to Users’ GMT earning, which makes earning unpredictable. To avoid any extrapolation on earnings, the settlement of GMT will be done in every several mins.



#### **Bitcoin Mechanic**

The GMT earning per person are pro rata based just like the difficulty bomb in Bitcoin and Ethereum design but **settles instantly.** The more users earning GMT at a given time, the less GMT earning will be available per person. Vice Versa.



#### **Comfort Mechanics**

The more Comfort, the higher the earning. GMT earning formula will be released once the earning is enabled in the app.

**Schadenfreude Pools**\
_‘Schadenfreude is the experience of joy that comes from learning of the failures of another.’_\
\
Schadenfreude Pools are the pools that users can subscribe to, in order to burn GMT and permanently earn GST return from other players’ misfortune moments, such as:

1. Receiving a lower quality Sneaker from higher quality Shoebox
2. Unsuccessful upgrade Gems.

Please note:

1. GST return comes from taking a small % tax from all users’ GST burning from Shoe-Minting or Gem upgrades.
2. The Schadenfreude Pools will have different varieties. Each variety of pools will correspond to a sneaker quality — hence five varieties of pools correspond to Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic and Legendary sneaker qualities. Each variety of pool will share the same % tax.
3. The smaller the size of the pool, the lesser GMT it takes to fill the pool. Once the lower sized pools are filled, the higher sized pool will be opened to subscribe.
