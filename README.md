**STEPN is a Web3 lifestyle app with inbuilt Game-Fi and Social-Fi elements**

**STEPN** is built around an essential daily activity for most people – moving around. We are the first project to effectively bring to life a functioning move\&earn concept, finishing 4th out of 500+ projects at the Solana Ignition Hackathon 2021.

Users equip themselves with NFTs in the form of Sneakers. By walking, jogging, or running outdoors, users will earn game currency, which can either be used in-game, or cashed out for profit.

With Game-Fi, **STEPN** aims to nudge millions toward a healthier lifestyle, combat climate change and connect the public to Web 3.0, all while simultaneously hinging on it’s Social-Fi aspect to build a long-lasting platform fostering user generated Web 3.0 content.



**Note: STEPN is currently under Public Beta Phase, so contents in the Whitepaper could be changed in the future.**
