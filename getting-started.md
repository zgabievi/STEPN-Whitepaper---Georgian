To start, users need to download the STEPN app

1. **Download the STEPN app** \
   Download from linktr.ee/stepnofficial.
2. **Sign-up for STEPN** \
   After getting access to the app on your respective device, you will be able to sign up for STEPN with your email address. You will receive a verification code that you need to key in to enter the app
3. **Create a new Wallet**\
   ****Click on the Wallet icon on the top right corner of the screen.\
   The app will generate a 12-word secret phrase. This will be used to recover your Wallet if you uninstall the app or forget your password. **Important** – Note this phrase and save it somewhere safe (Write it down physically and store it somewhere only you will have access to.)
4. **Transfer SOL into your in-app Wallet**\
   ****Transfer SOL to in-app wallet to buy NFT Sneakers in the Marketplace and always keep some SOL as gas in your Wallet account.
5. **Purchase a Sneaker**\
   ****Head over to the in-app Marketplace and pick out a Sneaker! You can use the Filter tool to look for a Sneaker type of your preference. Ensure you have enough SOL for the purchase.

Congrats! You are all set. After the purchase of a Sneaker, energy will restore at a rate of 25% every 6 hours (Fixed at AEDT Time 00:00, 06:00, 12:00, 18:00) **You can start your STEPN journey immediately after the first 25% energy restoration.**
