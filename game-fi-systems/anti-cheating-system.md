### Anti-Cheating System

Three mechanics are used to stop cheating in the game, which includes the cheater's account being punished:

* GPS tracking
* Motion sensor and health data
* Machine learning to detect cheating through data simulation

Using devices that have been jailbroken, rooted, or with an altered OS will result in STEPN not working properly.

Transferring Sneaker from one account to another account will result the Sneaker enters a Cooldown period, during Cooldown period, users cannot use this Sneaker.

If user loses energy because of transferring Sneakers from Inventory to the Wallet, all the unopened Mystery Boxes on the user's account will be burned/purged.&#x20;

Note that losing energy by listing a Sneaker in the marketplace will **NOT**  burn/purge Mystery Boxes.

Note that we will not assist you to retrieve your losing assets as a result of using GPS spoofing or hackware.
