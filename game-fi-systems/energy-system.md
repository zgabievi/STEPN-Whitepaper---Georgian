### Energy System

Energy replenishes 25% every 6 hours until it reaches to the Energy Cap. Users start with one Sneaker and 2 Energy Caps. Users can increase their max. Energy by holding more Sneakers. The calculation is as follows:

| **Sneaker No.** | **Energy** | **Move\&earn time (min)** | **Note**     |
| --------------- | ---------- | ------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1               | 2          | 10                        | Newbie       |
| 3               | 4          | 20                        | Daily User   |
| 9               | 9          | 45                        | Savvied User |
| 15              | 12         | 60                        | Pro User     |
| 30              | 20         | 100                       | Athlete      |

Additional Energy (cumulative) is given to users for higher Quality Sneakers:

1. Owning an Uncommon Sneaker: +1 Energy
2. Owning a Rare Sneaker: +2 Energy
3. Owning an Epic Sneaker: +3 Energy
4. Owning a Legendary Sneaker: +4 Energy

**EXAMPLE 1:**

1 Uncommon Sneaker + 1 Common Sneaker = 3 Total Energy (2 Base Energy + 1 Bonus)

**EXAMPLE 2:**

2 Rare Sneaker + 1 Common Sneaker = 8 Total Energy (4 Base Energy + 4 Bonus)
