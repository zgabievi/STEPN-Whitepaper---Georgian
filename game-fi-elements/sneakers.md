### Sneaker Attributes

1. **Efficiency (GST Earning) – Solo Mode, Marathon Mode**\
   ****In **Solo Mode**, Efficiency plays a part in GST earnings. Having a higher Efficiency Attribute will result in better GST earnings per Energy spent.\
   In **Marathon Mode**, higher Efficiency leads to a faster accumulation of Leaderboard points.
2. **Luck (Mystery Box) – Solo Mode, Sneaker Rental (Coming Soon)**\
   ****Luck determines the frequency and quality of a Mystery Box drop. Users are also able to receive Mystery Box drops while their Sneakers are leased out.
3. **Comfort (GMT Earning) – Solo Mode, Marathon Mode, Staking/Governance (Under  Development)**\
   ****The Comfort value has been reworked and currently under development.
4.  **Resilience (Durability/Repair) – Solo Mode, Marathon Mode**

    In **Solo Mode**, Resilience affects the decay rate of Durability. Higher Resilience will result in a slower Durability decay. \
    \
    The higher the Sneaker's level or quality, the higher the repair cost. Durability is a Sneaker’s “stamina” bar. As a user moves, Durability will decrease. Sneakers receive a “worn-out” penalty at 2 Durability touch points:

    1. At 50/100 Durability, Sneaker Efficiency drops to 90%
    2. At 20/100 Durability, Sneaker Efficiency drops to 10%

In **Marathon Mode**, resilience will allow users to earn more points as their Sneaker will stay above the “worn-out” penalty mark longer.

**Users will be able to burn GST/GMT to reset the Sneaker's Attribute points. The more frequent the reset, the more expensive it will be, with the cost capping at a certain level (Under Development).**

### Sneaker Types

There are four Sneaker types, each designed to suit a different exercise intensity and/or fitness level:

| **Name**    | **Optimal Speed (km/hr)** | **Base Return at Optimal Speed** |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Walker**  | 1 - 6                     | 4 GST / 1 Energy spent           |
| **Jogger**  | 4 - 10                    | 5 GST / 1 Energy spent           |
| **Runner**  | 8 - 20                    | 6 GST / 1 Energy spent           |
| **Trainer** | 1 - 20                    | 4 - 6.25 GST / 1 Energy spent    |

Users’ base GST return is not static, and several factors may cause it to fluctuate:

1. Sneaker Efficiency (Low Durability affects Efficiency).
2. GPS signal - users will earn less if GPS signal is poor.
3. Mobile Data signal strength and stability – if data signal is choppy, it could also reduce earnings.
4. Randomization.

Information on GMT Return rates will be provided in future updates.

### Sneaker Quality

There are five Sneaker qualities. When a Sneaker is minted, the value of each Attribute will be chosen at random within the min. and max. values according to Sneaker quality. As such, even Sneakers of the same quality may have vastly different Attribute distributions.

| Quality       | Min. Attribute | Max. Attribute |
| ------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| **Common**    | 1              | 10             |
| **Uncommon**  | 8              | 18             |
| **Rare**      | 15             | 35             |
| **Epic**      | 28             | 63             |
| **Legendary** | 50             | 112            |

### Sneaker Level

Users can level up their Sneakers by burning **GST,** with **GMT being required at certain milestones.** Each level-up takes a fixed time to complete, which increases along with the amount of **GST and GMT** required according to the Sneaker level. This process can be made faster/boosted up by using even more **GST**.&#x20;

**GMT** is currently required to level a Sneaker to Level 5, 10, 20, Level 29 and 30.

Upon level-up, users will attain 4 - 12 additional Attribute points to assign according to their Sneaker quality.

| Quality       | Attribute Point/Level up |
| ------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Common**    | 4                        |
| **Uncommon**  | 6                        |
| **Rare**      | 8                        |
| **Epic**      | 10                       |
| **Legendary** | 12                       |

Additional perks will be unlocked upon reaching certain level milestones:

| **Milestone** | **Triggered Event**            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Level 5**   | Unlocks Socket 1               |
| **Level 5**   | Unlocks Shoe-minting           |
| **Level 10**  | Unlocks Sneaker Lease function |
| **Level 10**  | Unlocks Socket 2               |
| **Level 15**  | Unlocks Socket 3               |
| **Level 20**  | Unlocks Socket 4               |
| **Level 30**  | Unlocks GMT earning            |

**At max level, user need to choose between earning GST or GMT. Switching between GST/GMT earning is allowed, but will be subject to a cooldown duration.**&#x20;

&#x20;****&#x20;

### Sneaker **Customization (Under Development)**

At Level 30, users have the option of burning GST/GMT/NFT to customize their Sneakers, including but not limited to - name changing, adding a quote, adding extra Attribute points etc. More detail about customization will be released soon.
