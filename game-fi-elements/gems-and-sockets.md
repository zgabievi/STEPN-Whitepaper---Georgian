### Gem Types and Level&#x20;

Users are able to unlock Gem Sockets once their Sneakers reach a certain level, and are able to enhance their Sneaker Attributes by inserting the corresponding Gems into the unlocked Sockets (i.e. only Efficiency Gems can be placed into Efficiency Sockets).

There are four types of Gems, with each Gem representing an Attribute:

1. Yellow: Efficiency
2. Blue: Luck
3. Red: Comfort
4. Purple: Resilience

By heading to the **Upgrade** tab under the **Gems** section, users can upgrade their Gems by burning **GST** and combining 3 Gems of the same level and type to a higher level (i.e three Level-1 Efficiency Gems to one Level-2 Efficiency Gem).

**GMT** will also be required to upgrade a Gem from Level 4 onward.

**Note: Low level Gems Upgrade has a chance to fail.**

**Warning: There is a certain percentage Gem upgrade which can fail from Level 1 - 5, if the upgrade fails, users will lose their Gems.**

**Awakening Effect: Gem boosts the Base Attribute of the Sneaker. i.e. A Level 2 Efficiency Gem will boost a Level 0 Sneaker with 5 Base Efficiency is 5 (Sneaker Attribute) + 5 x 40% (Gem Awakening Effect to Sneaker Attribute) + 8 (Gem Attribute) = 15.**

### Socket Types and Quality

A Sneaker has four different Sockets, identified by colors that match a Gem type. Users insert Gems into the Socket to boost the Sneaker's Attributes. One Socket is unlocked each time the Sneaker reaches level 5, 10, 15, and 20 respectively. Higher Socket quality will give extra boost to the inserted Gem's Attribute.

Users will be able to see the Socket type without unlocking the socket, but NOT the Socket quality, which is determined by the Sneaker's quality:

| **Sneaker Quality** | **Socket Quality % (Common)** | **Socket Quality % (Uncommon)** | <p><strong>Socket Quality %</strong></p><p><strong>(Rare)</strong></p> | <p><strong>Socket Quality %</strong></p><p><strong>(Epic)</strong></p> | <p><strong>Socket Quality %</strong></p><p><strong>(Legendary)</strong></p> | **Unlock Cost** | **Special Effect** |
